# FLL RobotSim
A simple simulator to help plan and generate python code for moving the robot around the challenge map.

Features:
  Drag the robot to any start position or enter values in the start position/rotation fields.
  Add commands to move and rotate the robot.
  Drag and drop to rearrange code.
  Generates python code that can be copied into spike prime.

TODO:
  Get waypoints to work. Would be great if you could add points by clicking and dragging reposition and waypoints could be used to elimate the need to add rotations for getting around the board.
  Python code needs to be customize for generating our specific commands.
  Add speed fields for adjusting speed.
